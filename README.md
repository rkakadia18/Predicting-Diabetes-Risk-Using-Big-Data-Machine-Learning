# Predicting-Diabetes-Risk-Using-Big-Data-Machine-Learning
First time learning about Big Data ( Apache Spark, Databricks, Cluster computing, Hadoop) for predictive analytics using machine learning models. 
Developed a scalable machine learning solution to predict diabetes risk, enabling earlier detection and preventive care. Used Apache Spark ML for big data processing and MLflow for experiment tracking and automation. Focused on building an accurate, efficient, and healthcare-ready model that supports real-time risk assessment and proactive intervention.
